1. Description of Procedure
This experiment investigates the pressure-temperature behavior of various gases (O₂, N₂, Ar, He, Ne) in a 6-liter vacuum chamber. The chamber is evacuated, filled with 1L of gas, and subjected to a temperature cycle from –8°C to 250°C. Pressure and temperature are recorded at each stage. The chamber is then vented and reset before repeating the cycle with a different gas.

2. Hazards Identified
Hazard	Potential Harm	Persons at Risk
High temperature (250°C)	Burns, fire hazard	Operator
Cryogenic/freezing conditions	Frostbite, thermal shock to glassware	Operator
Pressurized gas release	Inhalation, explosion risk	Operator, nearby lab users
Implosion of vacuum chamber	Flying debris, lacerations	Operator
Handling reactive gases (e.g. F₂, Cl₂)	Toxicity, corrosion, respiratory harm	Operator, lab occupants
Manual handling of chamber	Strain or injury	Operator
3. Risk Control Measures
Conduct all gas release steps in a fume hood or ventilated enclosure.

Use heat-resistant gloves and tongs when handling hot chamber.

Use cryogenic gloves and face shield when handling cold chamber.

Ensure pressure gauge and thermocouple are calibrated and functioning.

Use only compatible gases; avoid reactive gases unless proper containment and neutralization systems are in place.

Inspect chamber for cracks or damage before each cycle.

Secure chamber during heating/cooling to prevent tipping or spills.

Label chamber with “Hot Surface” or “Gas Release in Progress” signage as needed.

Ensure gas cylinders are secured and fitted with proper regulators.

4. Emergency Procedures
Gas leak: Evacuate lab, activate ventilation, notify supervisor and safety officer.

Burn or frostbite: Apply first aid, seek medical attention.

Implosion or equipment failure: Evacuate area, report incident, isolate equipment.

5. Risk Rating (Before and After Controls)
Hazard	Likelihood	Severity	Risk Rating	Residual Risk
Burns from oven	Medium	High	High	Low
Implosion	Low	High	Medium	Low
Gas inhalation	Medium	High	High	Low
Frostbite	Medium	Medium	Medium	Low
Toxic gas exposure (if used)	Low	Very High	High	Medium (with controls)
