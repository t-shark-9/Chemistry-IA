5.1 Materials: 
-6 liter vacuum chamber (would have been the one i was going to acquire, if you have one it would be the one you have)
-Vacuum compressor/pump 
-Oven (capable of reaching 250°C) / heating mantel
-Freezer (capable of reaching -8°C) / Cold Rooms
-Oxygen (O₂) 
-Nitrogen (N₂)
-Argon (Ar)
-Helium (He)
-Neon (Ne) / if unavailable (Hydrogen H2 / Carbon Dioxide CO2 / Fluorine Fl2 / Chlorine Cl2)
-Pressure gauge
-Thermometer or thermocouple

5.2 Procedure:
Creating the Initial Vacuum:
-Pull a vacuum on the 6-liter vacuum chamber with a compressor to achieve a partial vacuum (approximately 10,000 Pa (we would go as far to a vacuum as possible mine would only reach that)).

Temperature and Pressure Readings with O₂:
	-Add 1-liter O₂ gas to the vacuum chamber close of vacuum chamber  and disconnect from gas supply 
-Heat the vacuum chamber in an oven to 250°C.
-Wait 10 minutes so that the gas also has reached 250°C
-Record actual temperature and pressure.
-Sequentially change the oven temperature with the chamber inside and take measurements at the following temperature points:
- 200°C Wait 10 minutes, measure temp & pressure.
- 150°C Wait 10 minutes, measure temp & pressure.
- 100°C Wait 10 minutes, measure temp & pressure.
- 50°C Wait 10 minutes, measure temp & pressure.
-Remove the chamber from the oven, let it sit for 30 minutes.
-Place in the freezer until the chamber reaches -8°C, wait 10 minutes, and record temperature and pressure.

Gas Release and Chamber Reset:
-Open the vacuum chamber partially and place it in a fume hood / well circulated environment to allow the gas to dissipate.
-Wait 30 minutes until all gas has left the chamber open more if needet
-If the gas is heavier than air, tilt the chamber sideways to aid release.

Repeating the Cycle with Other Gases:
	-Repeat the same process for the following gases:
-Gas 2: Nitrogen
-Gas 3: Argon
-Gas 4: Helium
-Gas 5: Neon…

5.3 Risk assessment: 

Risk factor
Description 
Safety measure
Chemical Hazard
All gases except oxygen are inert, meaning no significant chemical risk.
No special chemical precautions needed.
Fire & Explosion Hazard
Oxygen is an oxidizer and can accelerate combustion
Ensure no open flames or flammable materials near the experiment.
Cryogenic Risk
Very low temperatures can cause frostbite or material damage.
Temperatures below -20°C are avoided to minimize cryogenic risks.
Oxygen Displacement
Inert gases (except oxygen) can reduce oxygen levels and pose asphyxiation risks.
Ensure good ventilation during and after the experiment to prevent gas buildup.
Oxygen Enrichment
Excessive oxygen levels can increase flammability of surrounding materials.
Prevent leaks, maintain ventilation, and avoid excessive oxygen exposure.
